# Welcome to Tropic Square GitHub

We are [Tropic Square](https://tropicsquare.com).
We develop, manufacture and sell auditable secure integrated circuits on the foundation of Security through Transparency.
We invite testing and evaluation to verify the security of our products. 

## TROPIC01

TROPIC01 is the first product in its lineup, serving as a cryptographic coprocessor that 
establishes a hardware root of trust, ensuring the protection of the systemâ€™s most sensitive assets while offloading cryptographic 
functions from an Microcontroller.

See [TROPIC01](https://github.com/tropicsquare/tropic01) repository for product documentation.
